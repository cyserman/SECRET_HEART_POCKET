The Complete Blueprint for an Intergenerational Legacy PlatformD

1. The Origami Protocol (Technical White Paper)

Abstract:
The Origami Protocol is a dynamic, recursive instruction framework for Agent Orchestration designed to bridge the gap between creative vision and technical execution. This protocol addresses the fundamental limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long-context software development tasks by introducing a state-dependent memory architecture. By treating the development process as a series of distinct "folds," we can maintain high-fidelity output over extended sessions, preventing the degradation of logic and intent that plagues traditional "waterfall" prompting methods.

1.1 The Theoretical Framework: Managing Cognitive Drift

The Fold (Modular Cognitive Load):
The protocol dictates that the AI’s attention must be restricted to the immediate "visible fold" of the project. In traditionale[ld Master" code provided by the user (Secret Heart Pocket Premium).
