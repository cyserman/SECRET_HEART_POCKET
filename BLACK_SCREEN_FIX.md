# 🔧 Black Screen Fix - Applied

## What Was Fixed

1. ✅ **index.html** - Updated to use `main.jsx` instead of `main.tsx`
2. ✅ **src/main.jsx** - Created with proper React mounting
3. ✅ **src/index.css** - Updated with Tailwind directives and global styles
4. ✅ **src/App.jsx** - Created from App.tsx, removed TypeScript syntax

## Build Status

✅ **Build succeeds locally** - No errors!

## Next Step: Push to Vercel

You have 3 commits ready to push:

```bash
# Use your GitHub token method:
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/cyserman/SECRET_HEART_POCKET.git
git push
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/cyserman/SECRET_HEART_POCKET.git
```

## After Pushing

Vercel will automatically:
1. Detect the new commits
2. Rebuild your app
3. Deploy the fixed version

The black screen should be resolved!

## Local Testing

```

**Status**: ✅ Fixed locally, ready to push to Vercel!
