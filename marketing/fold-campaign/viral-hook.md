## 📱 SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT PLAN

### Twitter/X Thread (Viral Potential: HIGH)

**Post 1/5**: 🧵 THREAD: I just discovered something that changes everything about AI coding

**Post 2/5**: The problem: AI coding feels like herding cats. You start with "build me a SaaS" and end up with 47 browser tabs, half-finished features, and zero momentum.

**Post 3/5**: The solution: The Origami Protocol. Instead of waterfall chaos, you work in "folds" - discrete, focused phases guided by a living PROJECT_STATE.md document.

**Post 4/5**: My AI assistant (CHRISTINE) keeps me on track. No scope creep. No lost context. Just systematic progress from idea to deployment.

**Post 5/5**: Built and launched my app in 4 phases. The Secret Heart Pocket is live: secret-heart-pocket.vercel.app

### LinkedIn Post (B2B Focus)

**Headline**: "From Napkin Idea to Live SaaS in 30 Days: The Secret Framework Big Tech Doesn't Want You to Know"

**Body**:
Fellow founders,

I used to think AI coding assistants were hype. "Sure, they'll write code," I thought, "but can they actually build something complete?"

Then I discovered the Origami Protocol.

Instead of the usual "build me X" prompts that lead to chaos, this system treats development as a series of "folds" - focused phases guided by a living document.

My latest project: The Secret Heart Pocket (secret-heart-pocket.vercel.app) - built and deployed in 4 systematic phases.

Key insight: AI doesn't replace your vision. It amplifies your execution.
