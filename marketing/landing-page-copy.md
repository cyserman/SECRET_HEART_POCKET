## 🤖 HOW IT WORKS SECTION

### Section Header
**The Science Behind Systematic Development**

### Step 1: The Fold Principle
**Visual**: Origami paper unfolding animation

Traditional development is "waterfall" - overwhelming and prone to failure. The Origami Protocol breaks projects into "folds" - discrete, manageable phases that prevent cognitive overload.

*"Focus on what matters now. Trust the process for what comes next."*

### Step 2: CHRISTINE Logic
**Visual**: AI assistant working systematically

Your AI becomes CHRISTINE - an autonomous project lead with three core functions:

**Analyze** → Cross-reference requests against current phase
**Drive** → Execute tasks with surgical precision
**Heal** → Self-correct errors and update project state

### Step 3: Living Documentation
**Visual**: PROJECT_STATE.md updating in real-time

Every project maintains a living `PROJECT_STATE.md` file that serves as:
- Long-term memory for AI assistants
- Progress tracking for developers
- Quality assurance checkpoint
- Hand-off documentation for teams

### Step 4: Guaranteed Deployment
**Visual**: Rocket launch animation

Following the protocol guarantees:
- No abandoned projects
- Production-ready code
- Systematic testing approach
- Successful deployment
