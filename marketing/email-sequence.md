## 📧 EMAIL 3: VALUE DELIVERY (Send 3 Days Later)

### Subject Line: 🧠 How to Think Like a SaaS Founder (Free Training)

### Preview Text: "The mindset shift that turns developers into entrepreneurs..."

### Email Body:

**Subject**: The SaaS Mindset: From Builder to Business Owner 🧠

[First Name],

You've experienced the Origami Protocol. You know it works for building apps. Now let's talk about building businesses.

## 🤔 The Critical Mindset Shift

Most developers build features. SaaS founders build growth engines.

**Feature Thinking**: "This button should be blue"
**Growth Thinking**: "This button increases conversion by 23%"

**Feature Thinking**: "Users can upload files"
**Growth Thinking**: "File uploads reduce churn by 34%"

## 📊 The SaaS Metrics That Matter

1. **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)** - Your north star
2. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** - How much to get a customer
3. **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)** - How much customers are worth
4. **Churn Rate** - How many customers you keep

**Pro Tip**: LTV should be 3x CAC. That's your growth formula.

## 🎯 Your SaaS Origin Story

Every great SaaS started with a founder's specific pain point. What's yours?

- **RecipeApp**: Sarah was tired of losing family recipes
- **DevTools**: Marcus needed better code review tools
- **NoteShare**: Alex wanted collaborative note-taking

What's the problem you wake up thinking about?

## 💰 Monetization Without Feeling Sleazy

The best SaaS pricing follows this formula:

**Free Tier**: Prove value, collect emails
**Pro Tier**: $9-29/month - Core value
**Enterprise**: $99+/month - Custom solutions

**Conversion Hack**: Start free, add value, then charge for scale.

## 🚀 Ready to Build Your SaaS?

The SaaS Founder Pack includes:
- Complete business model templates
