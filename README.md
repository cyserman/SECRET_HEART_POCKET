## 🔧 Configuration

### Firebase Setup

The app expects Firebase configuration to be provided at runtime via one of these methods:

1. **Global Variables** (Gold Master pattern):
   ```html
   <script>
     window.__firebase_config = '{"apiKey":"...","authDomain":"...",...}';
     window.__app_id = 'your-app-id';
     window.__initial_auth_token = 'optional-token';
   </script>
   ```

2. **Environment Variables** (Development):
   Create a `.env` file:
   ```env
   VITE_FIREBASE_CONFIG={"apiKey":"...","authDomain":"...",...}
   VITE_APP_ID=your-app-id
   VITE_INITIAL_AUTH_TOKEN=optional-token
   ```

## 📋 Development Roadmap

See `PROJECT_STATE.md` for the living roadmap and current status.

**Current Status**: Phase 1-4 Complete ✅ | Phase 5 (PWA + Deployment) Pending

## 🧠 The Origami Protocol

This project uses `PROJECT_STATE.md` as the Agent's long-term memory. After every task, the roadmap is "refolded" based on real-world results.

**Self-Healing**: The project evaluates success and updates the roadmap automatically.

**Drift Defense**: Before any command, the current state is verified to prevent "Shiny Object" hallucinations.
