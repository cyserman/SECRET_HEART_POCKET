# 🔍 Alternative Debugging Methods

## If Keyboard Shortcuts Don't Work

### Option 1: Tell Me What You See
Just describe what's on the screen:
- Is it completely white?
- Is it black?
- Do you see any buttons or text?
- What color is the background?
- Can you see a navigation bar or menu?

### Option 2: Mobile Device?
If you're on a phone/tablet:
- **Android Chrome**: Settings → Developer Options → Enable USB Debugging (then connect to computer)
- **iPhone Safari**: Settings → Safari → Advanced → Web Inspector (then connect to Mac)
- **Easier**: Just describe what you see!

### Option 3: Browser Menu Method
Try clicking the browser menu:
- **Chrome**: Click the three dots (⋮) in top-right → More Tools → Developer Tools
- **Edge**: Click the three dots (⋯) → More Tools → Developer Tools
- **Firefox**: Click the hamburger menu (☰) → More Tools → Web Developer Tools

### Option 4: Check the URL
What does the address bar show?
- Does it say `https://secret-heart-pocket.vercel.app/`?
- Or does it redirect somewhere else?

## Quick Visual Check

**Just tell me:**
1. What color is the screen? (white/black/colored)
2. Do you see any text? (what does it say?)
3. Do you see any buttons? (what do they say?)
4. Is the page completely blank?

That's enough info to diagnose! 🎯
