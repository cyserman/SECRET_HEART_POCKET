# 🔗 Find Your Live Site URL

## Your Site is Live! 🎉

Since the dashboard looks "happy", your deployment succeeded!

## How to Find Your URL:

### Method 1: Check the Dashboard
On your Vercel dashboard, look for:
- **"Domains"** section - Your URL will be listed there
- **Latest deployment** - Click it, there's usually a "Visit" button
- **Top of the page** - Might show the URL directly

### Method 2: Try These URLs

Your site is probably at one of these:
- `https://secret-heart-pocket.vercel.app`
- `https://secret-heart-pocket-[your-username].vercel.app`

**Try opening:** `https://secret-heart-pocket.vercel.app` in a new tab!

### Method 3: Check Deployment Details
1. Click on your latest deployment in the dashboard
2. Look for the URL in the deployment details
3. Or click "Visit" / "Open" button
